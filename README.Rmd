# googlePageSpeedR

This package makes a call to the Google PageSpeed Insights API and returns a data frame of results. 
Useful for analysing your / your competitors' page performance and organising into glorious tabular format.

### TODO
- Fix type coercion issues within results.

### Install

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Phippsy/googlePageSpeedR)
```

### Simple Query

We define the URL to analyse and then pass it to the `get_pagespeed()` function.

```{r}
library(googlePageSpeedR)
page <- "https://www.rstudio.com"
insights <- get_pagespeed(ps_url = page)
insights
```

We are given back a data frame containing a number of key metrics for the given page.

Definitions for each metric can be reviewed at [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/#metrics](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/#metrics)

### Provide an API key

The pagespeed insights API doesn't seem to require an API key, but you can provide one. Get your key from the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) then define it in your query.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_key <- "abcdefgHIJK"
insights <- get_pagespeed(ps_url = page, key = my_key)
```

### Multi-page query

Given that we have a convenient function for getting pagespeed insights, it's easy to iterate over many URLs and get a nice, large collection of results.

I favour the `tidyverse` approach and `map()` collection of functions, but you could achieve the results below with for loops or `apply()` functions, as you prefer.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
urls <- list("http://www.rstudio.com", "http://www.reddit.com", "https://www.python.org/", "https://myspace.com/", "https://www.linux.org")
multi_results <- map_df(urls, get_pagespeed)
multi_results
```

### Raw content query

If you prefer to get a list-format object returned, containing all available fields from the API's JSON response, you can do this using `get_pagespeed_content()`. From here, you can pick and choose whichever values you'd like.

```{r}
insights_content <- get_pagespeed_content(ps_url = page)
str(insights_content[1:5])
```
